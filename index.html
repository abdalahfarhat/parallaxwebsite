      <p>
        HTML 5 (formerly spelled HTML5[a]) is a markup language used for
        structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the
        fifth and current major version of the HTML standard, and subsumes
        XHTML. It currently exists in two standardized forms: HTML 5.2
        Recommendation[4] by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, a broad
        coalition of organizations), intended primarily for Web content
        developers; and HTML Living Standard [5] by WHATWG (a small consortium
        of four browser vendors), intended primarily for browser developers,
        though it also exists in an abridged Web developer version.[6] There are
        minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications. HTML 5 was first
        released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[7] with a major
        update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][8] Its goals
        are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and
        other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans
        and consistently understood by computers and devices such as Web
        browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain
        backward-compatible with older software. HTML 5 is intended to subsume
        not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML;[9] the HTML 4
        and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by HTML 5.2 on 27 March
        2018.[10]

      <h2>CSS 3 (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the
        separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
        complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation of
        formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
        page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
        on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
        which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
        element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

      <h2>NODE JS</h2>
      <p>
        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time
        environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
        Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in
        which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and
        run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.
        Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and
        for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic
        web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
        Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6]
        unifying web application development around a single programming
        language, rather than different languages for server side and client
        side scripts.
